PyQRNative Fork
---------------

I used this package in a project but it's not actually pip installable on file
systems that have case-sensitive filenames. It hasn't been updated in 4 years,
so rather than reach out to the original maintainer I just forked it here.

The original maintainer is Sam Curren and the original source is here:
